/**
 * Backtracking, CSP.

 * Crossword	design
 	 There	is	a	board	of	size:	n x	m and	a	set	of	words.
 	 We	need	to	find	such	a	way	of	writing	words	on	the board	such	that	one	cell
 	 includes	at	most	one	letter	and	every	continuous	sequence	of	letters	read
 	 horizontally	and	vertically	is	a	word	from	a	subset	of	the	size	k of
 	 the	set	S acquired	in	the	following  way
 	 	 a) download	the	list	of	English	lemmas	extracted	from	the	British	National	Corpus	prepared	by
 	 	 	Prof.	Adam	Kilgarriff:	https://www.kilgarriff.co.uk/bnc-readme.html
		 b) select	from	the	list	only:	adverbs	(adv),	verbs	(v),	adjectives	(a)	and	nouns	(n)
		 	Represent	the	problem	as	a	CSP

		2	points	– formulate	the	chosen	problem	as	CSP
		3	points	– implement	backtracking
		3	points	– compare	efficiency	of	processing	for	various	problem	parameters
		2	points	– give	a	correct	interpretation	of	the	results
